# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
This was a project for my Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree 
in which I completed the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of a sandwich once selected from a ListView.

This involved writing a method to manually parse json data into
custom Sandwich objects, creating a layout to present this data
in a way that made sense, and populating the views with the data
from a Java activity file.
